If these tests fail, it probably means you broke a delicate but important feature of the
CLI. Read this full docstring before changing these tests.


It's important to test the behavior of importing the globus_cli command tree to ensure
that it does not import the main globus_sdk components.

This is a performance enhancement which avoids paying the cost for expensive import-time
logic done in globus_sdk, requests, and urllib3 when the CLI is running a command like
  globus ls --help
or tab completion.

It is *very* easy to accidentally undo this performance improvement. For example, a new
module with an innocuous annotation:

    import globus_sdk

    def foo(client: globus_sdk.TransferClient) -> None: pass

The annotation should be deferred (default behavior on py3.10+) but because it isn't
quoted or guarded with `from __future__ import annotations`, it will evaluate at
runtime.

Because the overhead of `import requests` alone (let alone all of the SDK imports) is
about 100ms, it eats a significant chunk of our time budget for completions and other
very latency-sensitive usages. We need to ensure that doesn't get done when the CLI does
its (almost entirely eager) imports.
